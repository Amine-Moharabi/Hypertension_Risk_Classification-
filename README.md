"# Hypertension_Risk_Classification-" 
1. Model Type:
Random Forest for classification.
2. Target Variable:
P_Risk (a categorical variable).
3. Training Data:
70% of the data used to train the model.
4. Test Data:
30% of the data used to evaluate the model.
5. Number of Trees:
100 trees (set by ntree = 100).
6. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Rate:
Provides an estimate of the modelâ€™s generalization error during training.
7. Accuracy:
Proportion of correct predictions. Higher accuracy indicates better model performance.
8. Confusion Matrix:
Displays true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping to evaluate precision, recall, and F1 score.
9. Variable Importance:
Identifies the most influential features used in predicting P_Risk.
